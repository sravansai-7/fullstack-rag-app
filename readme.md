# Full-Stack RAG Q&A Application 📚🤖

This project is a complete full-stack web application that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It allows users to ask questions in natural language about a specific document and receive accurate, context-aware answers generated by Google's Gemini model.

It features a secure Python/Flask backend that handles the AI logic and a modern React/Vite frontend for a smooth user experience.

## **Features**

* **Accurate, Document-Grounded Q&A**: Answers are generated based on a specific source document, preventing hallucinations.
* **Modern React UI**: A clean, responsive user interface with real-time loading and error feedback.
* **Secure Python Backend**: The backend, built with Flask, securely manages the Google API key and all AI processing.
* **Efficient In-Memory Vector Search**: Uses FAISS for fast and efficient similarity searches directly in memory.

## **How It Works: The RAG Pipeline**

This application follows a two-phase RAG process:

1. **Indexing (On Startup)**: When the backend server starts, it loads the `my_document.txt` file, splits it into smaller text chunks, and uses Google's embedding model to convert each chunk into a vector. These vectors are then stored in a FAISS in-memory vector store, creating a searchable knowledge base.

2. **Retrieval & Generation (On Query)**: When you ask a question, the backend embeds your query into a vector, searches the FAISS store for the most relevant text chunks, and then passes both your question and the retrieved chunks to the Gemini model. This provides the model with the necessary context to generate a highly relevant and accurate answer.

## **Getting Started** 🚀

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.9 or higher) & `pip`
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* A Google Gemini API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).

### **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-rag-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-rag-app.git)
    cd fullstack-rag-app
    ```

2. **Set up the Backend Server:**
    * Navigate into the `server` directory:

        ```bash
        cd server
        ```

    * Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

        ```bash
        # Create the virtual environment
        python -m venv venv
        # Activate it (Linux/macOS)
        source venv/bin/activate
        # Or activate it (Windows)
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    * Install the required Python packages:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    * Create a `.env` file for your API key:

        ```bash
        touch .env
        ```

    * Add your Gemini API Key to the `.env` file:

        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```

3. **Set up the Frontend Client:**
    * Navigate from the root directory into the `client` directory:

        ```bash
        cd ../client
        ```

    * Install the required npm packages:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

### **Running the Application**

You must run both the backend and frontend servers in **separate terminals**.

1. **Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server**
    * Make sure you are in the `server` directory with your virtual environment activated.
    * Run the Flask application:

        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```

    * The server will start and be listening on `http://localhost:5000`. Leave this terminal running.

2. **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Client**
    * Make sure you are in the `client` directory.
    * Run the Vite development server:

        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

    * Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your web browser.

You can now ask questions about the `my_document.txt` file through the web interface!
